## Introduction
Indonesia is a country that is famous for its diversity. in terms of culture, language and even traditional food. Traditional Indonesian food has a strong taste from traditional ingredients in Indonesia. For each province in Indonesia, it has a distinctive taste in each region according to the tongue of the surrounding community.

The number of traditional Indonesian foods makes it difficult for people to recognize these types of foods and where they come from. Therefore, this application was built using deep learning technology. It is hoped that this application will help Indonesian people recognize typical food from their own area or from other areas to maintain sustainability.

## Dependecies
This project is built using Deep Learning Technology with Convolutional Neural Network algorithm and Transfer Learning. Here is the library that was used in this project.

- Python 3.7.0
- TensorFlow 2.0.0
- NumPy 1.21.6
- Matplotlib 3.5.1

## Dataset 
We are gathering our dataset manualy from many sources. Consisting 6 indonesian traditional foods to classify, including :

- Clorot
- Dadar Gulung
- Klepon
- Lapis Legit
- Onde-Onde
- Putu Ayu
